	body: "To say that Fit to Recover is a special place would be the understatement of the century. If FTR could be summed up into one word (although it's SO much more than one word could ever fulfill), it would be gratitude - gratitude for the opportunity to volunteer with this incredible non-profit organization for the past nearly two years; gratitude for the many experiences that I have shared and look forward to sharing with those who are involved with FTR; and gratitude for this platform to share what FTR means to me with anyone who is currently a member of FTR or contemplating becoming a member of FTR. Personally, FTR has taught me that it's okay to be vulnerable and talk about how you're feeling. There is tremendous power in numbers and community, and not everything in life needs to be tackled alone. If you're looking for a safe place to build a community and feel like you belong, come check out what FTR is all about. Take a fitness class, attend a nutrition workshop, sign up for a creative writing session, serve those in need via community outreach events, or record a song to document your recovery journey. Most importantly, find what works best for you and your personal recovery. Give it a chance and you'll feel the warmth, support, and authenticity of those around you. You won't regret it. ~ Steph, FTR Dietitian"

	body: "I love Fit To Recover! I attend classes at FTR 5-6 days a week. The community is so friendly and inclusive. They all welcomed me into the classes with open arms and taught me proper technique for all the exercises we were doing. The people there are so friendly and supportive when it comes to my health, happiness and recovery. I had a lot of reservations about trying it out and I'm so glad that I tried it anyway. I love the gym, the staff, and the other members. I have made dear relationships with the people there and it has helped me to become the better me, mentally, physically and spiritually. I would recommend FTR to everyone. Thank you Fit To Recover for being such an awesome part of my life."

	body: "Fit to Recover has been an essential part of my recovery. Sobriety to me is continuously trying to make my quality of life the best it can be. Improving and growing physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Fit to Recover helps me do just that. I get to be a part of this incredible group of people. I get to run with them, or work out with them, on Saturday mornings at the boot camp. I get to talk with them and meet new people in the recovery community. I get to be a part of something and fit in somewhere. I get to be vulnerable and get out of my comfort zone and push myself. Fit to Recover is a community that we (in recovery) need and I am so grateful that Ian and Charlie have started this. Thank you guys for helping me better myself!"

Not only do you feel better about yourself, but you have support from others that know how you feel and welcome you with open arms regardless of your past. Fit To Recover is focused on an individual’s future. I wouldn't want to imagine my life without Fit To Recover in it. It's positive and productive and everyone is invited. What better way to get the most vulnerable lost part of the community together and give hope in the darkest times. THANK YOU IAN AND CHARLIE!!! "

I have had the pleasure of knowing Charlie for a couple years now. He is a kind-hearted, compassionate, and caring man that has not only helped me in times of distress, but helps all who reach out to him. I couldn't be prouder of both Charlie and Ian and look forward to how their ventures continue to positively impact, and change the lives of others. Congratulations to you both! -Andrew "

I really love these active recovery groups that are showing others that their recovery doesn't have to be all sitting in some boring group drinking coffee all night. Get to know one another,  go out and get some exercise and feel good about your body, and learn some sense of accomplishment. That's how I want to lead my recovery! Thanks for the run tonight guys!"

But with help and motivation from Ian and Charlie, I have looked at my future in a different perspective. I got sober November 17, 2013, and I would say that both of these gentlemen helped me through my toughest doubts about being sober. I am now almost ninety days sober and I give thanks to myself and the FTR community. Thanks for everything you guys have done."

They inspired me to look into starting a sober hockey league after going back home from Utah and I am looking into it. I am going to join our local sober softball team and talk about starting other sports. I am grateful for my sobriety today. I have 5 months of sobriety and just keep focusing on today. My life is going so much better now because I am focusing on my recovery as well as my fitness and its keeping my mind centered. Ian has really helped me develop skills to deal with my anxiety so I don't even think about drinking or using today. He got me motivated in exercising and eating healthy. Not sure if I can eat as much chicken as he does, but my life style has changed by his encouragement as well as Charlie's."

I look up to him in so many ways, and has helped me with so many issues and situations.Ian has taught me how much exercise and being active is to my recovery. Not only physical health, but emotional and inner health. FTR has become an important aspect of my life. Just sittin at a process group, being able to feel comfortable enough to say my true feelings without judgement, then having the group all do a mind clearing exercise is by far one of the healthiest, most cleansing things I do. I love FTR for that and love Ian, he has become my big bro"

	body: "I've known Ian for a little over a year now. I had the wonderful opportunity to work very closely with him in recovery for 6 months when he lived in Colorado. Through working so close with him, I've found that Ian is a dedicated worker and passionate about sharing hope with those struggling. Often we would talk about terrible circumstances he was placed in, and the ability of rising above those struggles to come to the aid of others going through the same pain. I'm a big advocate of what he has done with Fit To Recover and his dedication to making a fit sober community grow and flourish. I think it's a great addition to one's personal recovery to have a community around you focused on bettering yourself not only spiritually, but physically as well. I'm proud to say I know Ian today and is considered one of my closest friends. I've gotten to see the real depths of who he is and I can say that he's a wonderful guy with nothing but love for those around him."

We all have struggles and issues in our own life. I don’t personally struggle with drugs or alcohol, but I lost my mother to addiction. I understand the importance of support when someone is trying to keep clean. It is vital to help overcome the hardships by finding other outlets of a healthy nature. Ian’s Bootcamp is a place where there is constant support. One in need of help can find friends that will talk and support their decision to live a healthy life, while helping their body get back into physical shape. Love, Support, Friendship, Spirituality…. these can all be found at Fit To Recover. –James "

	body: "Having gone through rehab, hospitals, and many programs and therapies, what has helped me the most is Ian's boot camp, runs, and overall help towards not only my physical recovery, but mental and spiritual recovery as well. I feel and see the results that working out, running, and working with others has brought to my recovery, and that's because of Ian's program. I am nearly 5 months sober, and more fit than I have been in my life, and I owe that to Ian. I have done the work, but Ian paved the way, and showed me fitness to recover. He has pushed me to push myself, the whole time using exercise as a metaphor for recovery. The effect has been life changing. Fit to Recover has played a major role in saving my life, for this I am forever grateful. It's not because of Ian I'm sober, but without his influence I don't think I would be. "

	body: "Ian has been my personal trainer since 2011. When I started training with him my goal wasn't only to lose weight but change my life style. In the past, other trainers only helped me to, literally, lift weights, but Ian became a great support in reaching my goal. Ian is a highly motivated person who strives to help the people he works with. His success is your success. He is a person who genuinely cares about you and your performance. He is very savvy in terms of nutrition and he always inculcates that healthy eating and exercise go together to have that healthy lifestyle I was aiming for. He helped me lose about 45 pounds. His is an example of determination and drive. His running group and Bootcamps every week are only two examples of what Ian Acker does to help people like me achieve our goals. Thank you Ian for all you do for me!"
