	body: "To say that Fit to Recover is a special place would be the understatement of the century. If FTR could be summed up into one word (although it's SO much more than one word could ever fulfill), it would be gratitude - gratitude for the opportunity to volunteer with this incredible non-profit organization for the past nearly two years; gratitude for the many experiences that I have shared and look forward to sharing with those who are involved with FTR; and gratitude for this platform to share what FTR means to me with anyone who is currently a member of FTR or contemplating becoming a member of FTR. Personally, FTR has taught me that it's okay to be vulnerable and talk about how you're feeling. There is tremendous power in numbers and community, and not everything in life needs to be tackled alone. If you're looking for a safe place to build a community and feel like you belong, come check out what FTR is all about. Take a fitness class, attend a nutrition workshop, sign up for a creative writing session, serve those in need via community outreach events, or record a song to document your recovery journey. Most importantly, find what works best for you and your personal recovery. Give it a chance and you'll feel the warmth, support, and authenticity of those around you. You won't regret it. ~ Steph, FTR Dietitian"

	body: "I love Fit To Recover! I attend classes at FTR 5-6 days a week. The community is so friendly and inclusive. They all welcomed me into the classes with open arms and taught me proper technique for all the exercises we were doing. The people there are so friendly and supportive when it comes to my health, happiness and recovery. I had a lot of reservations about trying it out and I'm so glad that I tried it anyway. I love the gym, the staff, and the other members. I have made dear relationships with the people there and it has helped me to become the better me, mentally, physically and spiritually. I would recommend FTR to everyone. Thank you Fit To Recover for being such an awesome part of my life."

	body: "Fit to Recover has been an essential part of my recovery. Sobriety to me is continuously trying to make my quality of life the best it can be. Improving and growing physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Fit to Recover helps me do just that. I get to be a part of this incredible group of people. I get to run with them, or work out with them, on Saturday mornings at the boot camp. I get to talk with them and meet new people in the recovery community. I get to be a part of something and fit in somewhere. I get to be vulnerable and get out of my comfort zone and push myself. Fit to Recover is a community that we (in recovery) need and I am so grateful that Ian and Charlie have started this. Thank you guys for helping me better myself!"

	body: "Fit To Recover is an amazing program that Ian and Charlie have started. There is a level of maintaining sobriety and what better way than fitness. Not only do you feel better about yourself, but you have support from others that know how you feel and welcome you with open arms regardless of your past. Fit To Recover is focused on an individualâ€™s future. I wouldn't want to imagine my life without Fit To Recover in it. It's positive and productive and everyone is invited. What better way to get the most vulnerable lost part of the community together and give hope in the darkest times. THANK YOU IAN AND CHARLIE!!! "

	body: "One of the greatest blessings recovery gives us is the ability to conceptualize a dream and through hard work and perseverance, be able to have that dream come to fruition. I have had the pleasure of knowing Charlie for a couple years now. He is a kind-hearted, compassionate, and caring man that has not only helped me in times of distress, but helps all who reach out to him. I couldn't be prouder of both Charlie and Ian and look forward to how their ventures continue to positively impact, and change the lives of others. Congratulations to you both! -Andrew "
